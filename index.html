<p>Gravy is a rapid application development framework that adopts left of center tools and enables developers to deliver code that is as elegant as the mainstream tools making the entire process a breeze.<br>
The tools that Gravy is based on are:<br>
1.<a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> as the primary language.<br>
2.<a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google Guice</a> as a DI mechanism.<br>
3.<a href="http://www.jooq.org/">JOOQ</a> for database operations.<br>
4.<a href="http://spockframework.github.io/spock/docs/1.0/index.html">Spock</a> as as testing f/w.<br>
5.<a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> as a build tool.<br>
6.<a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet</a> as the API f/w.  </p>

<p>Gravy glues all of it together elegantly and abstracts away some of the learnings in real world projects that the maintainers have had to present you with a toolbelt that is as delicious as it looks!</p>

<p>Gravy would not have been possible but for the existence of <a href="https://github.com/RobertFischer/Restling">Restling</a> a f/w curated by <a href="https://github.com/RobertFischer" class="user-mention">@RobertFischer</a>.
Request you all to check it out.</p>

<h3>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Web development in Java has long been dominated by a certain segment of tools for specific use.(A certain DI f/w,a certain ORM f/w,a certain testing f/w and so on).Nothing wrong with them but majority of the developers use this without understanding how it works.This is akin to a magician believing in his own tricks and this can't possibly yield any good.
Gravy is a framework that has been designed to enable developers to break away from this tunnel vision and present a toolset that enables developers to witness the magic that happens at their hands.<br>
On top of it ,Gravy seamlessly integrates with other f/w in the ecosystem without any hassle.<br>
We hope you will love using the f/w as much as we have had fun developing it.  </p>
