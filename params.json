  "body": "###Introduction\r\nGravy is a rapid application development framework that adopts left of center tools and enables developers to deliver code that is as elegant as the mainstream tools making the entire process a breeze.  \r\nThe tools that Gravy is based on are:  \r\n1.Groovy as the primary language.    \r\n2.Google Guice as a DI mechanism.      \r\n3.JOOQ for database operations.  \r\n4.Spock as as testing f/w.  \r\n5.Gradle as a build tool.   \r\n6.Restlet as the API f/w.\r\n\r\nGravy glues all of it together elegantly and abstracts away some of the learnings in real world projects that the maintainers have had to present you with a toolbelt that is as delicious as it looks!\r\n\r\n###Special Mentions\r\nGravy would not have been possible but for the existence of Restling a f/w curated by @RobertFischer.\r\nRequest you all to check it out.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWeb development in Java has long been dominated by a certain segment of tools for specific use.(A certain DI f/w,a certain ORM f/w,a certain testing f/w and so on).Nothing wrong with them but majority of the developers use this without understanding how it works.This is akin to a magician believing in his own tricks and this can't possibly yield any good.\r\nGravy is a framework that has been designed to enable developers to break away from this tunnel vision and present a toolset that enables developers to witness the magic that happens at their hands.  \r\nOn top of it ,Gravy seamlessly integrates with other f/w in the ecosystem without any hassle.  \r\nWe hope you will love using the f/w as much as we have had fun developing it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMaintained by\r\n@kaddiya   \r\n@sudarshan-webonise  \r\n@ameyawebonise   \r\n\r\n",
